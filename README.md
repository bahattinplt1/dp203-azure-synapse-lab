# Azure Synapse DP-203 Lab Scripts

This repository contains SQL scripts developed during the DP-203: Azure Data Engineer Associate lab focused on using Azure Synapse Analytics to transform and analyze data stored in a data lake.

## 📁 Scripts Included

| Script Name                    | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `create-sales-db.sql`         | Creates the `Sales` database, external data source, and file format. |
| `create-external-table.sql`   | Transforms CSV data and writes the result to an external table (`ProductSalesTotals`). |
| `create-stored-procedure.sql` | Defines a stored procedure (`sp_GetYearlySales`) to generate yearly sales data as an external table. |
| `sales-csv-query.sql`         | Reads the top 100 rows from raw sales CSV files in the data lake. |

## 📦 Folder Structure in Data Lake

- `csv/` – Contains raw sales data (2019–2021)
- `productsales/` – Output folder generated by `ProductSalesTotals` external table
- `yearlysales/` – Output folder generated by `sp_GetYearlySales` stored procedure

## 💡 Purpose

This project demonstrates how to:
- Use serverless SQL pools in Synapse Analytics
- Query and transform raw data stored in a Data Lake
- Create and use external tables
- Encapsulate transformation logic in stored procedures

## 🚀 Technologies

- Azure Synapse Analytics  
- Serverless SQL Pools  
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2  
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
